# Text-Classification using Naive Bayes

In this project Multinomial Naive Bayes has been implemented from scratch to understand its working.
The problem I have chosen is Text Classification.
Given a text document we aim to predict the news group category (out of the the 20 given categories) it belongs to.
There are 20000 documents from which we use 15000 as training data and 5000 documents are used for testing purpose.
Our model has an accuracy of 0.82
